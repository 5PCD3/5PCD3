## Welcome üëãüèº

Hey there! I‚Äôm **Priyangshu Chandra Das**, currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Technology** at the **[National Institute of Technology Agartala](https://www.nita.ac.in/)**. I‚Äôve gained solid hands-on experience in Python, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll likely find me playing or watching football ‚öΩÔ∏è.

## Featured Projects üöÄ

### [Twitter Hate Speech & Abusive Language Detection](https://github.com/5PCD3/Twitter-Hate-Speech-Abusive-Language-Detection-and-Moderation-Classifier.git) ‚Ä¢ [Demo](https://github.com/5PCD3/Twitter-Hate-Speech-Abusive-Language-Detection-and-Moderation-Classifier/blob/main/TwitterHatespeechDetectionAppDemo.gif) ‚Ä¢ [Web App](https://twitter-hate-speech-abusive-language-detection-and-moderation.streamlit.app/)

Developed an automated classification model for detecting hate speech and abusive language on Twitter. The dataset consisted of **24,802 tweets**, which were preprocessed using NLTK. The Logistic Regression model, powered by Bi-Grams from `CountVectorizer`, achieved an impressive **Recall (TPR) of 93.63%**. An interactive version is live on the Streamlit platform!

### [Time Series Forecasting of Stock Market](https://github.com/5PCD3/Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Stock-Market.git) ‚Ä¢ [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oh8d2PHSPVdGgRDcfngezcrEm1K5ZTgS/view?usp=sharing)

Performed deep **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on stock market data, visualizing daily closing prices. After testing stationarity with statistical techniques like the **Dickey-Fuller Test** and **ACF/PACF** plots, I implemented a **Time Series Forecasting Model (ARIMA)** that achieved **96.59% accuracy**, with a **MAPE of 3.41%** for the next 16 predictions.

### [Face Detection Attendance System](https://github.com/5PCD3/Face_Detection_Attendance_System.git) ‚Ä¢ [Demo](https://github.com/5PCD3/Face_Detection_Attendance_System/issues/1)

Created an attendance system using **facial recognition** with **Tkinter** (for GUI) and **OpenCV** (for image processing). The system registers new users, logs attendance in real-time, and stores data in an Excel file. Fully automated, from user login to attendance tracking!

---

### [Pneumonia Classifier](https://github.com/5PCD3/Pneumonia-Classifier-Project.git)

Developed an image classification model using **Deep Learning** to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. The user-friendly **Streamlit interface** allows users to upload images and receive instant predictions, helping in rapid diagnosis.

---

### [Diamond Price Prediction](https://github.com/5PCD3/DiamondPricePrediction.git)

Built a regression model to predict diamond prices using data from Kaggle. Multiple feature selection techniques were employed to optimize performance, with the final **Linear Regression** model achieving an **RMSE of 1013.90**.
